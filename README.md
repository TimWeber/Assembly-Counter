# Assembly-Counter
This was some work set to me in one of my modules at university. The aim was to learn and get used to working in Assembly.

## Aim
Learning to work with Assembly, using MPLAB IDE. The counter displays numbers 0-9 on a 7-segment display.

### This Project involved working with/using:
* Assembly language
* 7-segment display

## What I learnt
This is my first time using the Assembly language. I will be continuing to use this language to be completing ever more complex tasks.
